# Hash-Table
This is a simple implementation of a hash table in C, demonstrating basic operations such as inserting words, counting occurrences, and freeing memory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use `gcc` or any other C compiler of your choice.

### Compilation

Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
gcc test.c hash.c -o hash_example
```

### Execution

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./hash_example
```

## Usage

The program inserts a list of words into the hash table, counts occurrences, and prints words with a count greater than or equal to 2.

## File Structure

- `hash.h`: Header file containing the hash table structure and function declarations.
- `hash.c`: Implementation of hash table functions.
- `test.c`: Test program demonstrating the usage of the hash table.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the test data in `test.c` or adjust the hash function in `hash.c` to suit your specific use case.
